        <img src="alyssanicole.jpg" alt="Alyssa Nicole Sacar" class="responsive-img">
        <p class="font">Hello! Greetings! I am Alyssa Nicole I. Sacar, a 3rd-year BSIT student from BISU-Balilihan. I am 22 years old born in Tagbilaran City, raised in Quezon City, Manila. I have a few hobbies to share which are listening to music, mainly kpop and R&B, playing computer and mobile games, as well as watching anime and korean dramas. A little background of me is I graduated high-school and my senior high years in Manila. I have a lot of foods that I usually crave, one of it are Korean Foods. Fun fact about me is I used to take swimming lessons when I was young and as my instructor taught me how to float, I almost drowned so since then, I haven't tried and even pursued learning how to swim again.</p>
